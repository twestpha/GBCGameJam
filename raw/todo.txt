    [x] Detecting enemies in view, putting them into scene
    [x] Either rolling because of clear or pop up and down in cover
[x] Get dialogue scenes/terminals working

[x] RPG mechanics? Menu? Not sure...
    I feel like shooter mechanics are a more streamlined fit
    - equipment
    - bullets and inventory
    - maybe more like survival shooter a la resident evil
