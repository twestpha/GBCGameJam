[/] Gotta rework how enemy placement works... fuck
[/] Aim View enemy [/] rolling, [/] ducking/unducking, and [/] firing projectiles
[/] Killing enemy deleting from topdown
[/] Enemy respawning to position correctly
[/] Either rolling because of clear or pop up and down in cover

#### TODO ######################################################################

[x] Definitely a couple small bugs around enemy placement
[x] Fix shittyInvsin(). It's too shitty
[x] Sometimes enemy doesn't end up in correct spot when exiting aiming
[x] Bullets don't collide after reloading...? After enemy ducks?

Short term goal:
[x] 1 playable level with 1 enemy type
    [x] Topdown enemy [/] patrolling, [x] engaging, and [x] firing projectiles
[x] player death, restarting
    - shitty placeholder start screen
[x] 1 terminal with some story

-- Main Game --
[x] Get enemy interactions working
    [x] Detecting enemies in view, putting them into scene
[x] Get dialogue scenes/terminals working

-- Stretch goals --
[x] Get lighting scene integrated, light switch working
[x] Get save points working
[x] RPG mechanics? Menu? Not sure...
    I feel like shooter mechanics are a more streamlined fit
    - equipment
    - bullets and inventory
    - maybe more like survival shooter a la resident evil
