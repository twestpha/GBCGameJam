-- Main Game --
[x] 1 playable level with 1 enemy type
    [x] Walking mode enemy [/] patrolling, [x] engaging, and [x] firing projectiles


-- Stretch goals --
[x] Multiple enemies
[x] Get lighting scene integrated, light switch working
[x] Get save points working
[x] RPG mechanics? Menu? Not sure...
    I feel like shooter mechanics are a more streamlined fit
    - equipment
    - bullets and inventory
    - maybe more like survival shooter a la resident evil
